I edited a bunch of maps.
This mod is in development


Does it work with SVE?
No, and it never will.
Does it work with RSV?
I made a map edit so the path to Ridgeside works, but testing is needed for their schedules, and the festivals are not set up.
Does it work with East Scarp?
Yes.
Might need edits, but it worked when I tested it.
Does it work with Sunberry?
Not tested.

Things to do (not in order)

Edit Festivals in town to match new Town map 

remove alter from seed shop
change Sunday schedules to go to the house of worship instead of the seed shop

make unique interiors for:
Plant House (Bailee)
Yellow House
Red House
Brick House Left (Noa & Christopher)
Brick House Right
Riverside Diner (Bridget)

Test mod with Ridgeside Village
Test mod more with East Scarpe


Make character sheets for Christopher, Bridget, and Bailee (currently Harvey and Abigail twins)
Make more NPCs.
Bailee's parents
A Nurse (Maru working at the clinic doesn't seem to fit her to me. I want her to focus more on Robots and science, not medicine.)
I am bad with coming up with personalities, so my NPCs are all Antisocial. My goal is to make the town more active, not to give you more friends. If someone else wants to develop these characters more then that, ask me first, and don't ignore the NPC notes I have in their .json




NOTE:
NPC Portraits (except Matthias) were made using https://jazzybee.itch.io/
So was my profile picture.
